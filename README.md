# Texas Capital Collective In-House Backtesting Engine

## Create an algorithm
All algorithms must inherit the `Algorithm` class.\
To run your algorithm, create a script:
 * You can use `Engine` to run your algorithm and backtest it
 * Use `Chart` to plot the results of your backtests

## Contributing
